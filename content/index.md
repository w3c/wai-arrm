## Introduction to ARRM

The ARRM Introduction takes users through the steps they will follow to apply the ARRM methodology. Using the multi-step ARRM tool, users will be able to map specific accessibility tasks within their development life cycle to identified roles within the product team.

## Role-Based Decision Tree

The Decision Tree is a customizable framework to help teams define a matrix of their own within their organization. Use it to assign primary, secondary, or contributor level accountability for task-related responsibilities.

## Role Definitions

To avoid confusion around role-naming conventions, Role Definitions are provided as a baseline to identify common stakeholders in a typical web development lifecycle.

## Responsibilities Matrix

Using the roles defined and agreed upon, the Matrix provides:
* A set of role-specific grids for each role
* A set of ownership assignments for every WCAG Success Criteria
* A set of sample considerations prioritizing responsibilities
