## Tasks to get started

Below is a list of tasks for content authors to get started making your work more accessible to disabled people. If these tasks aren't met, your content can create barriers to users with disabilities.

You can also get the full list of [Tasks Involved in Accessibility as a web page](/planning/arrm/tasks/) with other roles, or download the [CSV file]({{ "/content-assets/wai-arrm/arrm-all-tasks.csv" | relative_url }}).

<table>

    <tr>
      <!-- Only include specific columns in the header - exclude: Starter List -->

## Case study: How to use the tasks {#how-to-use-the-tasks}

A good way to get familiar with the tasks is to do a short case study. Think about how you might tackle the task in your role.

Then, think of how meeting this task impacts an end user.

### Task:

IMG-002: Informative images are described with a clear and meaningful text equivalent (alt attribute or other equivalent means).

### Primary Role: Content Author

"As the primary owner of this task, I will ensure that any images that contain information or represent an action or a symbol for the user, and are not just decorative - have a descriptive and meaningful text alternative that will be announced by screen reader software."

### Secondary Role: None

There is no secondary owner of this task.

### Contributor Role: None

There is no additional contributor for this task.

### End user persona: Lakshmi, a senior accountant who is blind

Lakshmi is blind and uses a screen reader (speech-to-text software) and keyboard to navigate web pages. She uses websites daily for research and financial transactions. This design task ensures she isn't confused by an unexpected behaviour, i.e., when her keyboard focus lands on a button for the first time and content is announced automatically or the button automatically opens another page.

The intent of the task is to ensure that functionality is predictable as visitors navigate their way through a document.

This task helps people with visual disabilities, cognitive limitations, and motor impairments by reducing the chance that a change of context will occur unexpectedly.

[Read Lakshmi's full story](/people-use-web/user-stories/story-three/) and learn about other design tasks that benefit users like her.

## Additional resources

*   Use the [Alt Text Decision Tree](/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to help decide if an image needs a description.
*   Use the [Tips for Writing](/tips/writing/) to get started.
*   Review the [Images Tutorial](/tutorials/images/) for guidance on different types of images.

## Draft review questions

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="How do you want to use this page?" icon="comments"%}
{:/}

For the later iterations of this page, we could:
- Provide the 'Tasks to get started' as separate tables by content type â€” images and graphs, semantic structure, ... like the full [Tasks page](/planning/arrm/tasks/)
- Provide all the tasks, in addition to the tasks to get started
- Provide filters to select what to show

Would that be particulalry useful to you? Or, are you comfortable downloading the [CSV file]({{ "/content-assets/wai-arrm/arrm-all-tasks.csv" | relative_url }}) and using your spreadsheet software to see what you want?
