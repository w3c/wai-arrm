**Key Deliverables**

*   HTML and CSS files
*   Client-side scripting
*   JavaScript libraries and frameworks
*   Etc.

**Tasks include**

*   Pattern libraries and prototypes
*   Template functionalities

*   Use and adapt frameworks and content management systems
*   Etc.

**Example job titles for this role**

Front End Developer, Web Developer, Full-Stack Developer, UI/UX Developer, JavaScript Developer, UI/UX Engineer.

## Tasks to get started

Below is a list of tasks for front-end developers to get started making your work more accessible to disabled people. If these tasks aren't met, your code can create barriers to users with disabilities.

You can also get the full list of [Tasks Involved in Accessibility as a web page](/planning/arrm/tasks/) with other roles, or download the [CSV file]({{ "/content-assets/wai-arrm/arrm-all-tasks.csv" | relative_url }}).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <!-- Only include specific columns in the header - exclude: Starter List -->
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>WCAG SC</th>
      <th>Level</th>
      <th>Task</th>
      <!-- <th>Main Role</th><th>Primary Ownership</th><th>Secondary Ownership</th><th>Contributor</th> -->
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for row in site.data.arrm.arrm-all-tasks %}
      <!-- Only display rows where 'Starter List' is not null or empty -->
      {% assign starter = row["Starter List"] %}
      {% assign primary = row["Primary Ownership"] %}
      {% if starter and starter != "" and primary == "Front-End Development" %}
        <tr>
          <td>{{ row["ID"] }}</td>

## Case study: How to use the tasks

A good way to get familiar with the tasks is to do a short case study. Think about how you might tackle the task in your role.

Then, think of how meeting this task impacts an end user.

### Task:

INP-004: All actionable elements can be reached, using only the keyboard.

### Primary Role: Front-end Developer

As a front-end developer, I will code all functionality of the content, on a web page and/or within individual components and elements, to ensure it is operable through a keyboard interface only. This also allows switch control systems to operate.

### Secondary Role: UX Designer

As the UX designer in support of the Front-end Developer, I will ensure to annotate my designs, wireframes and prototypes to clearly define the functionality of components on the page and the expected reading order to allow a keyboard user access to the page content.

### End User persona 1: Marta, a marketing assistant who is deaf and blind

Marta is a marketing assistant who is deaf and recently became legally blind too, which means she can see only small portions of a screen and read text when it is significantly enlarged. She uses screen magnification software to enlarge the text on websites to a suitable font size, displays text on a refreshable Braille device and a large computer screen with high resolution and high luminosity (brightness).

The viewport, or area that Kaseem sees when the screen is magnified, is very small. So the focus must be in or very close to that 'viewport' at all times. Shifting it unexpectedly to a completely different areas of the screen makes it very difficult to find and then move to that area, especially if she has no idea where the focus has landed. The focus could move to another area on the page, or to a completely new page.

### End user persona 2: Lakshmi, senior accountant who is blind

Lakshmi is blind. She is a semopr accountant at an insurance company that uses web-based documents and forms over a corporate intranet and like many other blind computer users, she does not read Braille.

Lakshmi relies on the screen reader assistive technology to let her know where she is on the web page. Moving the focus unexpectedly breaks the context of the page and her mental map or perception of the page.

## Additional resources

*   Use the [WAI Tips for Developing](/tips/developing/) to get started.
*   See the [WAI Tutorials](/tutorials/) for menus, tables, forms and more.
*   Review the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) for keyboard functionality for ARIA components.

## Draft review questions

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="How do you want to use this page?" icon="comments"%}
{:/}

For the later iterations of this page, we could:
- Provide the 'Tasks to get started' as separate tables by content type â€” images and graphs, semantic structure, ... like the full [Tasks page](/planning/arrm/tasks/)
- Provide all the tasks, in addition to the tasks to get started
- Provide filters to select what to show

Would that be particulalry useful to you? Or, are you comfortable downloading the [CSV file]({{ "/content-assets/wai-arrm/arrm-all-tasks.csv" | relative_url }}) and using your spreadsheet software to see what you want?
